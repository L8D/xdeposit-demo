# Free Market Protocol / Core

`@freemarket/core` is the core module of Free Market Protocol.

This module contains the foundational components of Free Market Protocol and is required for all other modules to build and function.

This module is set up in the conventional way for a Hardhat project, with the following directories:

### `/contracts`

This directory contains the base Solidity code contracts of Free Market Protocol. There are no deployable contracts in this module, but it does contain interfaces and commonly used data structures.

### `/tslib`

This directory contains TypeScript code that is used by the other modules. It contains base interfaces, data structures, and other common code.
