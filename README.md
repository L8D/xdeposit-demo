Free Market is a protocol designed to extend arbitrary message passing protocols with a ruleset that ensures requisite conditions are sequentially met throughout complex transactions that involve multiple blockchains. The protocol is anchored by a workflow engine that follows paths through onchain branch nodes.
Interoperability remains in its nascent stage and presents difficulties for builders in planning and execution. This results in a cumbersome user experience, where end-users are faced with significant challenges in determining the appropriate steps and sequence of actions to reach a desired outcome.

## Road Map
- SDK: Author workflows using a high-level DSL
- More integrations, for example swapping via Uniswap/Sushiswap or 1inch
- Gelato Relay support:  pay for transaction gas using any asset, not just native
- Branch nodes:  enable on-chain decisions at transaction time to take different paths through your workflows
